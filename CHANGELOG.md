# Changelog

Every release, in words a user can read. Newest first.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-08-19

Domain 2, best practices: the canonical linter per ecosystem.

- `procoder lint` and `/procoder:lint`: golangci-lint (Go), ruff check
  (Python), shellcheck (shell), eslint (JS/TS, only where the project
  carries a config — procoder imposes no rules). The write hook lints the
  file just written in-turn; the gate lints the changed set.
- Report by default — lint is judgment, formatting was not; a repo opts
  into blocking with `[lint] policy = "block"` in .procoder/config.toml.
- Missing linters read as NOT checked, never clean; configless JS/TS is
  labeled out of scope.
- `/procoder:update`: update the plugin from the marketplace and verify
  the new version by direct invocation.

## 0.8.2 — 2026-08-19

- The README must carry the current version on its first screen — a
  blocking docs check, born from three releases shipping against a badge
  frozen at 0.7.0. Prose claims aren't file paths, so drift never fired;
  now a release without a reviewed README reds the gate. The README's
  domain list also caught up (documentation shipped, the index noted).
- The call graph dropped its noise: compiler-local temporaries and bare
  package descriptors are excluded from the edges (7,012 → 2,587 on this
  repo, all signal), `callers` shows each named call once with readable
  symbols (`io/ReadAll()`, not the SCIP provenance header).

## 0.8.1 — 2026-08-19

- The skills are back: command definitions moved from TOML with multiline
  strings — which the plugin loader silently drops — to Markdown with YAML
  frontmatter, the canonical format. Same nine commands, now actually
  registered.

## 0.8.0 — 2026-08-19

The code index (D-INDEX): the shared platform layer under the domains.

- `procoder index build|find|search|refs|outline|impact|stats` and the
  `/procoder:index` skill. Broad tier from universal-ctags (definitions,
  outlines, fuzzy search); precise tier from SCIP (scip-go and friends) for
  exact references — every answer says which tier produced it, and a stale
  index says so out loud.
- `index impact`: the blast radius of the working-tree change — which
  symbols it defines and which files reference them; the gate prints it
  and /procoder:pr makes the agent verify the named files.
- The security/maintainability surface, built now: `index callers` (the
  call graph from SCIP occurrences), `index unused` (dead-code
  candidates, exported API marked), `index entrypoints` (mains and the
  exported surface), and `index graph` (the machine-readable edge list
  future domains walk).
- The write hook keeps the broad tier current for each file written; the
  gate rebuilds a stale index at the finishing moment, covering editor
  edits and the precise tier the hook cannot reach.
- Tool resolution got honest: a probe rejects macOS's BSD ctags impostor,
  and `~/go/bin` / `~/.local/bin` count as installed.

## 0.7.1 — 2026-08-19

- The docs scan now asks git which Markdown belongs to the repository
  (tracked plus untracked-but-not-ignored) instead of walking every
  directory — gitignored scratch is no longer scanned.
- The PR-template mirror is enforced: drift between .github/ (the path
  GitHub reads) and the .procoder/github/ master now blocks the gate.
- The merge watcher got a protocol: calibrate against previous runs, poll
  per job in the foreground, report the first failure immediately with its
  log excerpt, poll dynamically — never a fire-and-forget monitor.
- Issue templates caught up with the reset: no more dropped "levels",
  Node-era fields, or renamed config paths.

## 0.7.0 — 2026-08-19

Domain 5, documentation: docs treated as a product.

- `procoder docs [--external]` and `/procoder:docs`: broken relative
  references and non-compiling Mermaid diagrams block; doc drift, missing API
  doc comments (Go/Python/TypeScript), required docs, badges, and README
  first-screen structure are reported; `--external` adds `lychee` link
  checking and GitHub Pages health.
- The write hook now checks Markdown references and diagrams in-turn, and
  reports which docs mention a code file the agent just changed.
- New repo-owned rules: `.procoder/docs/RULES.md` and the shared Mermaid
  theme `.procoder/docs/mermaid.json` (printed by `procoder templates`).
- Docs site: MkDocs Material built and deployed to GitHub Pages by CI.
- `doctor`/`init` learn `lychee`, `mmdc`, and `mkdocs`.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-08-18

Repo-overridable workflow rules (D-OVERRIDE begins here).

- `.procoder/github/WORKFLOW.md`: feature work in git worktrees, PR polling
  delegated to a watch-only background agent, full local+remote cleanup after
  a successful merge. The repo's file wins over the skills' defaults.
- Fixed `RepoRoot` to recognize a worktree's `.git` file — commands run
  inside a worktree no longer report against the parent checkout.

## 0.5.x — 2026-08-17

Domain 9, GitOps/GitHub, hardened by its own dogfood runs.

- The gate's git slice: conflict markers, junk files, oversized files
  (5 MB default), AI-attribution lines in commit messages (blocking — the
  work is the author's), commit subject shape, default-branch policy.
- `actionlint` on every workflow file written, findings in the same turn.
- PR and commit templates under `.procoder/github/`, `/procoder:pr` and
  `/procoder:merge` skills, `procoder scrub`.
- 0.5.1 fixed the gate exiting 0 over blocking findings; 0.5.2 fixed Windows
  test stubs and stopped prettier flagging the commit template's functional
  blank lines.

## 0.4.0 — 2026-08-17

- `procoder init [--yes]`: the binary computes the install plan per machine,
  the agent (or `--yes`) executes it, and the survey re-runs afterwards —
  an installer's exit 0 is a claim; the tool resolving is the fact.

## 0.1.0 – 0.3.0 — 2026-08-17

The Go rewrite and the plumbing proof (domain 6, formatting).

- One static binary per platform, committed in `dist/`, installed via the
  Claude Code marketplace; hooks and skills call a thin launcher.
- Formatting via each ecosystem's canonical tool (gofmt, ruff, prettier,
  rustfmt, clang-format, shfmt) with three honest verdicts: clean,
  unformatted (formatted bytes handed to the agent), unchecked (said out
  loud, never silent). The write hook hands the agent the formatted code and
  never touches the file (P-CONTROL).

Before 0.1.0 the project was a TypeScript analyzer engine; that history is in
git. The design reset that produced the current harness is recorded in the
design contract.
